miny vm type of project. allows you to run programs written in the form of 

{load, 2}
{add, 3}
{sub, 1}
{print, 0}
{halt, 0}

currently uses a single "register", though this is a work in progress.
also requires programs be baked into programs.c. this is not nice at all, also a wip

planning on adding args to select programs / enter an interactive env

/* old */
uhhh i guess this is a miny cpu type of program

gpt recommended that i tackle this so... idk, we'll see

;-;
